# sms_spam_classifier
SMS spam classification is an important tool for protecting individuals and businesses alike from unsolicited messages. With advances in Machine Learning, companies are now able to deploy algorithms to detect and classify spam messages with a high degree of accuracy. This technology can be used to screen incoming messages, block spoofed numbers, and even identify malicious SMS campaigns. By leveraging AI-powered SMS spam classification techniques, organizations can protect themselves from phishing scams, malware threats, unwanted promotions, and more.
